# StringContainer

#### **Namespace**: Unity.SaveData
---

## Summary:
`StringContainer` is a concrete implementation of `DataContainerBase<string>`, designed for storing a single string value. This component allows for the association, management, and easy update or reference of string values with GameObjects.

## Key Features:
- **String Value Storage**: Maintains a single `string` value, enabling easy access and updates.
- **Data Identification**: Utilizes a unique ID (`PropertyName`) for efficient identification of the data container.

## Usage Example:
- Attach the `StringContainer` component to a GameObject within your Unity scene.
- Set the desired string value via the component's properties in the Unity Editor.
- Within your game's logic, use the `StringContainer`'s `Value` property to access and, if necessary, update the string value.

## Additional Information:
- `StringContainer` is particularly useful for managing single pieces of string data in games, such as player names, status messages, or labels for interactive objects.
- Inherits from `DataContainerBase<string>`, ensuring compatibility with the `SaveDataControl` system for straightforward data persistence and retrieval.

`StringContainer` offers a robust tool for efficiently managing string data, enhancing data management flexibility in game development. By employing this component, handling string data within games becomes more organized and flexible, leading to cleaner and more maintainable game logic.
