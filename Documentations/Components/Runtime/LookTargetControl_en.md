Certainly! Now, I'll provide the English translation of the analysis for the `LookTargetControl` code.

# LookTargetControl

#### **Namespace**: Unity.TinyCharacterController.Control
---

## Summary:
`LookTargetControl` is a component used to orient towards a specified `Target`. If `Target` is not set, the `Priority` of this component becomes 0.

## Features and Operation:
- **Target Orientation**: Aims the character towards the direction of the specified `Target`.
- **Priority Control**: If the `Priority` is higher than other components, the character will face the direction of `Target`.
- **Speed Adjustment**: The turning speed can be adjusted with `TurnSpeed`. Setting it to -1 makes the character face the target immediately.

## Properties

| `Priority` | Priority of the turning action. |
