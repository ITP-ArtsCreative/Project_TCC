# StringArrayContainer

#### **Namespace**: Unity.SaveData
---

## Summary:
`StringArrayContainer` is a specific implementation of `DataContainerBase<string[]>`, designed for storing arrays of strings (`string[]`). This component facilitates the association and management of string arrays with GameObjects, allowing for easy updates and access when necessary.

## Key Features:
- **String Array Storage**: Holds data of type `string[]`, enabling straightforward access and modifications.
- **Data Identification**: Uses a unique ID (`PropertyName`) to efficiently identify the data container.

## Usage Example:
- Attach the `StringArrayContainer` component to a GameObject in your Unity scene.
- Configure the string array you wish to store via the component's properties in the Unity Editor.
- Access and modify the string array within your game's logic using the `StringArrayContainer`'s `Value` property as required.

## Additional Information:
- `StringArrayContainer` is particularly useful for managing sequences of string data in games, such as dialogue texts, item names, character names, etc.
- Inherits from `DataContainerBase<string[]>`, ensuring compatibility with the `SaveDataControl` system for easy data persistence and retrieval.

`StringArrayContainer` offers a robust solution for efficiently managing arrays of strings, enhancing data management flexibility in game development. Utilizing this component promotes a more organized and flexible approach to handling string data within games, contributing to cleaner and more maintainable game logic.
